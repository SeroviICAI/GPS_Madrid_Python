# GPS_Madrid_Python
## Description
This project includes a graph object created from scratch in Python and a GPS application from Madrid using Dijkstra Shortest Path Algorithm. In order to recreate Madrid's map, I used official data from https://datos.gob.es/es/catalogo/l01280796-callejero-informacion-adicional-asociada-codigos-postales-zonas-ser-categoria-fiscal-parcela-catastral-etc1. These data contain several errors, so a lot of data analysis and cleaning was required. Python's library networkx was used to draw the graphs.

## How to run the application
First and foremost unzip the directions compressed file, yo may also download it from the webpage above. Note: The csv was too big to be uploaded in github. Then install all the requirements specified on "requirements.txt" and run "gps.py" in your Python intepreter.
